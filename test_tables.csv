1,main.js - rawData and mediaUtils,"Initial page load in a modern desktop browser.","window.mediaData.rawData contains six companies with non empty years arrays and realistic subscriber values.","Pending – update with pass/fail and any quirks you notice once you've run this check.","Good quick sanity check after any major data change or refactor to be sure nothing fundamental broke in the dataset.","Open the app in the browser; open DevTools console; type window.mediaData.rawData and review its contents."
2,main.js - rawData structure,"App loaded with no interaction yet.","Each company entry in rawData has a company_name string, a years array, and each year has a quarters array.","Pending – confirm structure matches this description once inspected.","If this structure drifts, a lot of visualization bugs will follow, so it's worth double-checking when you edit the data model.","In the console inspect window.mediaData.rawData; expand a few company objects and confirm the nested structure matches expectations."
3,main.js - mediaUtils.streamToCompany,"Developer calls to mediaUtils.streamToCompany with valid keys HBO HULU AMAZON DISNEY NETFLIX SPOTIFY.","For each valid key the function returns the exact same uppercase string; no null values are returned for these inputs.","Pending – after running, note if any mapping is missing or mistyped.","This function underpins all the charts, so even a small typo here can silently break a specific provider's visuals.","Open DevTools console; call mediaUtils.streamToCompany for each known symbol; compare outputs with the inputs."
4,main.js - mediaUtils.streamToCompany,"Developer calls to mediaUtils.streamToCompany with an unknown key such as FOO.","The function returns null and does not throw any error.","Pending – record whether the call safely returns null without noise in the console.","This is mostly a guardrail check to make sure the app fails gracefully when someone wires a bad symbol.","In the console call mediaUtils.streamToCompany('FOO'); confirm the result is null and no error appears."
5,main.js - mediaUtils.extractSeries,"Developer calls mediaUtils.extractSeries for a known company for example NETFLIX.","The function returns labels and values arrays of equal length with labels formatted as year and quarter such as 2019 Q4 and values as numbers.","Pending – once tested, jot down if label formatting or lengths look off.","A mismatch here will lead directly to broken lines or misaligned tooltips, so it's worth being precise.","In the console call mediaUtils.extractSeries('NETFLIX'); check that labels and values align and that the label format looks consistent."
6,main.js - mediaUtils.extractSeries,"Developer calls mediaUtils.extractSeries with a non existent company name such as FOO.","The function returns an object with empty labels and values arrays and does not log any errors.","Pending – confirm the function behaves quietly and predictably in this case.","This helps make sure future code that calls extractSeries defensively won't blow up on unknown inputs.","Call mediaUtils.extractSeries('FOO') in the console; verify both arrays are empty and no error is thrown."
7,index.html main.js styles.css,"Fresh page load on desktop with no logos selected and default Line Chart active.","The comparison area shows the empty state message and illustration; no chart data is drawn; comparison area does not have the has-data class.","Pending – after loading, mark here whether the empty state looked correct on your machine.","This is the baseline user experience, so if this feels confusing or broken it's worth revisiting the copy and visuals.","Open the app; scroll to the comparison section; visually confirm the empty state and check the element classes with DevTools."
8,index.html main.js styles.css,"Clicking the NETFLIX logo button once from the initial state.","NETFLIX becomes selected and its logo button gains the active class and glow effect; selectedStreams now contains NETFLIX; the empty state hides and the line chart renders NETFLIX data.","Pending – note whether the visual feedback and chart update feel snappy or laggy.","This is a core interaction, so pay attention to how responsive and satisfying it feels, not just whether it technically works.","Click the NETFLIX logo; watch for the visual change; open the console to confirm selectedStreams and look at the chart update."
9,index.html main.js styles.css,"Clicking the NETFLIX logo button a second time after it is already active.","NETFLIX is removed from selectedStreams and its button loses the active class; if no other services are selected the empty state reappears in the comparison area.","Pending – confirm that toggling off works cleanly and log any flicker or delay you see.","Users often change their minds, so this off state should feel as polished as turning things on.","Activate NETFLIX then click it again; confirm the glow and active styling disappear and the empty prompt is shown if it is the only selection."
10,index.html main.js styles.css,"Dragging the HBO logo into the comparison area drop zone from the popular section.","HBO is added to selectedStreams and its button becomes active; the chart for the current visualization updates to include HBO; console logs show HBO in the selected set.","Pending – record whether drag and drop feels natural and whether the drop zone reacts the way you expect.","If this interaction feels fiddly, consider adding hover feedback or snapping so it's harder to miss the target.","Click and drag the HBO logo over the comparison area; drop it; watch the visual feedback and inspect the console output."
11,index.html main.js,"Using the search bar by typing a partial match such as net into the input.","The search results box displays a clickable result button labeled NETFLIX and the placeholder text is replaced by real content.","Pending – capture whether search feels responsive and whether the result appears quickly enough.","If there's noticeable lag, it might be worth debouncing or trimming the search logic a bit.","Type net in the search box; observe the searchResults container and confirm a NETFLIX button appears."
12,index.html main.js,"Clicking a search result button such as NETFLIX after typing in the search box.","The corresponding stream is added to selectedStreams and the search result button toggles to an active look; the associated logo button also becomes active and charts update to include that stream.","Pending – after trying this, jot down whether the cross highlighting between search and logos worked as expected.","This flow bridges the search UI and the main selection controls, so consistency really matters here.","Type net; click the NETFLIX search result; verify both the result and the main logo show active styling and that the chart redraws with NETFLIX data."
13,index.html main.js,"Clearing the search input back to an empty string after previously typing some text.","The search results list is cleared or only shows the placeholder message and no stale entries remain; no errors occur during typing or clearing.","Pending – confirm the results area resets nicely and note any odd flicker or left over buttons.","Search UIs often feel sticky if old results hang around, so this is mostly a polish check.","Type a few letters that produce results; then delete them until the input is empty; watch the searchResults area for correct clearing behavior."
14,index.html styles.css,"Switching between visualization type buttons for example from Line Chart to Bubble Chart to Area Chart to Heat Map while at least one stream is selected.","Only the chosen chart container is visible at a time with display block and the others are hidden; the active button styling follows the selected chart; the underlying data stays consistent.","Pending – once you've tried this, note if any chart lags behind or fails to update.","This is a high level smoke test that the whole visualization toggle concept feels cohesive.","Select a couple of services; click each viz-option button in turn; confirm only the matching chart canvas shows and the visual style of the selected button updates correctly."
15,index.html styles.css,"Resizing the browser window to a width below 768 pixels to simulate tablet or small laptop.","The layout becomes vertical with the sidebar stacking on top; charts shrink in height but remain readable; nothing overlaps or overflows awkwardly.","Pending – add comments here if any layout breakpoint felt awkward or cramped.","This check helps you catch mobile and tablet layout issues before they surprise real users.","Open the app; gradually narrow the browser window below 768 pixels; check the sidebar position chart sizing and overall layout responsiveness."
16,chartLine.js main.js,"Selecting only NETFLIX with Line Chart active on a desktop screen.","The main line chart displays a single red line for NETFLIX with chronological labels from the earliest NETFLIX data through the latest; tooltips show values in millions when hovering.","Pending – verify the line and tooltips match expectations and mention any small visual oddities.","This is the simplest single series slice of the product and should feel very clean and readable.","Activate only the NETFLIX logo; hover along the line; confirm the labels ordering and tooltip content."
17,chartLine.js main.js,"Selecting multiple services such as NETFLIX AMAZON and DISNEY while viewing the line chart.","Each service appears as its own colored line that follows the combined timeline; the legend lists all selected companies; missing quarters are handled smoothly without broken visuals thanks to spanGaps.","Pending – record whether all lines and legend entries matched the selected set.","Pay attention to color contrast and line overlap here since it directly affects how legible comparisons are.","Activate NETFLIX AMAZON and DISNEY; observe the chart; compare line colors against companyColors and verify the legend cross references."
18,chartLine.js main.js,"Clearing all selections while the line chart is visible.","The line chart removes all datasets and labels; any mini range chart shows no data; the comparison area goes back to the empty state view.","Pending – make a quick note if anything remained on screen after clearing.","This is a good way to surface state management bugs where chart data hangs around longer than it should.","Select one or more services; then deselect all of them; confirm the line disappears and the empty state returns without errors."
19,chartLine.js main.js,"Having at least one service selected so the range selector should appear below the main line chart.","The rangeSelector container shows a mini line chart of all selected data and a draggable window with handles and shaded side masks.","Pending – confirm the mini chart appears and feels roughly aligned with the main chart.","If this mini view feels confusing, you may want to add labels or a short hint in the UI later.","Enable a few services; scroll below the main line chart; verify the small overview chart and the draggable selection window are present."
20,chartLine.js main.js,"Dragging the center of the range window left or right to focus on a different time slice.","The main line chart smoothly updates its x axis to show only the portion of the timeline within the selected window while the mini chart remains unchanged.","Pending – once tried, log whether the motion and redraw feel smooth enough.","This is a UI affordance that can easily feel jumpy, so it's useful to pay attention to perceived smoothness here.","With multiple years visible click and drag the interior of the range window; watch the main chart labels and lines adjust as you move the window."
21,chartLine.js main.js,"Dragging the left and right handles of the range window inward to narrow the visible time range.","The main chart zooms into the chosen date range and its axes rescale appropriately without visual glitches or console errors.","Pending – capture whether the handles respected reasonable minimum widths and stayed within bounds.","Edge cases around min and max zoom are common spots for off by one bugs or awkward behaviour.","Grab the left handle drag it inward; then adjust the right handle; confirm that only the desired segment of the time axis appears in the main line chart."
22,chartLine.js main.js,"Viewing event markers with NETFLIX and DISNEY selected around key dates such as 2007 Q1 and 2019 Q4.","Vertical colored marker lines appear at those dates with small dots at the top; hovering shows a short tooltip naming the event and date.","Pending – after testing, note if markers lined up with the expected dates.","These markers are a nice storytelling detail, so it's worth confirming they feel trustworthy.","Activate NETFLIX and DISNEY; look for vertical markers on the timeline; hover near them and read the mini tooltip content."
23,chartLine.js main.js,"Clicking on an event marker line associated with a known milestone such as the Netflix streaming launch.","A new browser tab opens to an external page for more details about the event while the existing page continues to function normally.","Pending – mark whether the external links opened reliably and in a new tab.","Keep an eye out for pop up blockers or warning messages in your browser as well.","With the marker visible click directly on the marker line or dot; watch the browser open a new tab and check for any script errors."
24,chartLine.js main.js,"Selecting only a company that has no configured event markers such as HULU.","No vertical event marker lines are shown on the chart even though HULU data is plotted; the chart remains clean.","Pending – confirm no stray markers appeared and the chart looked uncluttered.","This keeps charts for companies without major events from feeling noisy or inconsistent.","Activate only HULU; scan the chart for event marker lines; confirm that none are present."
25,chartArea.js main.js,"Switching to Area Chart when no streams are selected.","The areaChart canvas loads with a dark background and empty datasets; the range selector for the area view either stays empty or hidden; there are no console errors.","Pending – add a quick note if you see any error messages or unexpected UI.","This is mainly a does nothing weird happen check for the area chart when there's no data.","Click the Area Chart button while nothing is selected; verify that no colored areas are drawn and that the browser console stays quiet."
26,chartArea.js main.js,"Switching to Area Chart with several services selected such as NETFLIX SPOTIFY and HULU.","A stacked area chart appears with layers for each company; tooltips show per company subscriber counts and a footer line that gives the total market at each point.","Pending – record whether the stack ordering and tooltip totals looked sensible.","Area charts can be visually busy, so make sure the end result still feels understandable at a glance.","Activate at least three services; then choose Area Chart; hover over different time points and read the tooltip content."
27,chartArea.js main.js,"Including a service with sparse quarterly data like HBO in the area chart.","The HBO area does not drop to zero at missing quarters; instead it carries forward the last known value so the stack remains continuous and visually sensible.","Pending – confirm the HBO area looks continuous rather than broken.","If you see sudden drops to zero, it may signal a bug in the carry forward logic.","Select HBO along with another service; examine the stacked areas where HBO lacks explicit quarters; confirm the shape stays flat rather than disappearing abruptly."
28,chartArea.js main.js,"Viewing the mini area chart range selector under the main area chart with multiple services chosen.","The areaRangeSelector container appears with a compact stacked area visualization and a draggable window very similar to the line chart range selector.","Pending – after using it, note whether the control felt discoverable and useful.","Because this is a second range UI, consistency with the line chart's version helps users a lot.","With two or more services selected and Area Chart active scroll below the main area plot; check that a mini chart and its handles are in place."
29,chartArea.js main.js,"Dragging the area chart range window or its handles to zoom in on part of the timeline.","The main stacked area chart updates to show only labels and data within the chosen range and the effect feels responsive and stable.","Pending – jot down if you noticed any lag or visual tearing during the zoom.","This is especially important on lower end machines where redrawing large stacked areas can be expensive.","Drag the edges and center of the range window; watch how the main area chart redraws and make sure axes and stacks remain correct."
30,chartArea.js main.js,"Clearing all selections while the Area Chart is visible.","All area datasets and labels clear out; the mini overview chart is emptied; the comparison area returns to its empty state without script errors.","Pending – confirm that both the main and mini charts fully reset.","If anything remains faintly visible, it might point to a state cleanup issue.","With Area Chart active deselect every logo; check that the area view resets and that the UI returns to the start prompt."
31,chartBubble.js main.js,"Selecting Bubble Chart with no streams selected at all.","The bubbleChart canvas is visible with a plain dark background; no bubbles are drawn and no animation runs; there are no console warnings.","Pending – verify the canvas stays calm and the console is clean.","Because the bubble chart uses animation, it's important that it sits quietly when there's nothing to show.","Click the Bubble Chart button with nothing selected; inspect the canvas visually and confirm there are no active bubbles or errors."
32,chartBubble.js main.js,"Selecting only NETFLIX while Bubble Chart is active.","A single red bubble appears sized according to Netflix subscribers; the bubble gently floats in a small circle around its center position; the bubble stays fully within the canvas bounds.","Pending – after running, note whether the label and sizing felt right and whether the animation was smooth.","This is a simple case to gauge whether the sizing formula feels intuitive and the animation is pleasant before adding more bubbles.","Activate NETFLIX and ensure Bubble Chart is chosen; watch the canvas for one clear bubble that gently floats; confirm it never touches the edges."
33,chartBubble.js main.js,"Selecting all six services while Bubble Chart is active.","Six bubbles appear each with its own color; each bubble floats gently at its own speed in small circles; all bubbles stay within canvas bounds and don't overlap excessively.","Pending – record if any bubbles went off screen or if the animation felt too fast or distracting.","We intentionally have more tests around the bubble chart because animation and positioning can hide subtle issues.","Turn on AMAZON DISNEY HBO HULU NETFLIX and SPOTIFY; observe the bubble field for a while; confirm all bubbles stay visible and the motion feels natural."
34,chartBubble.js main.js,"Hovering over a bubble without clicking.","The cursor changes to a pointer icon; the hovered bubble stops floating and stays in place; the bubble gains a stronger outline and higher opacity; a tooltip appears showing company details.","Pending – confirm the hover state feels clear and responsive and the tooltip shows correct data.","This small interaction does a lot of work to make the chart feel tactile and explorable.","Move the mouse slowly across different bubbles; pause over one; confirm the cursor changes, the bubble stops moving, and the tooltip appears."
35,chartBubble.js main.js,"Hovering over a bubble long enough to see the tooltip panel.","A floating tooltip appears near the cursor that shows the company name the most recent subscriber count and the period label formatted neatly.","Pending – write down any mismatches you spot between the tooltip and chart data.","Tooltips are often how people actually read numbers, so accuracy and legibility matter a lot here.","Hover over a bubble while watching the area around the cursor; read the tooltip text and check that the numbers match the underlying data for that company."
36,chartBubble.js main.js,"Moving the mouse away from a hovered bubble.","The bubble resumes its gentle floating animation; the tooltip disappears; the cursor returns to default; the bubble's visual highlight is removed.","Pending – after trying this, note whether the transition back to floating felt smooth.","This helps confirm that the animation restart logic works correctly and doesn't cause any visual jumps.","Hover over a bubble; then move the mouse away; watch the bubble start floating again and confirm the tooltip disappears cleanly."
37,chartBubble.js main.js,"Deselecting all services while bubbles are visible and floating.","All bubbles disappear immediately; the animation loop stops so CPU usage remains modest; the canvas shows only the dark background; no ghost tooltips linger.","Pending – confirm that animation stopped and that performance looked normal.","Keep an eye on laptop fans or Task Manager/Activity Monitor if you suspect the loop kept running.","With several services selected click each logo again to deselect; watch the canvas clear and confirm that no animation or tooltips remain."
38,chartBubble.js main.js,"Resizing the browser window while the bubble chart is running with multiple bubbles floating.","The canvas resizes to match its container; bubbles reposition themselves within the new bounds accounting for their size; all bubbles remain fully visible; the animation continues smoothly.","Pending – note whether resizing introduced any jank or visual glitches and whether bubbles stayed properly positioned.","The bubble chart is more demanding than the others, so this is a good moment to spot layout and performance issues.","With Bubble Chart visible resize the window wider and narrower; watch how the bubbles adapt to the canvas size and confirm none go off screen."
39,chartBubble.js main.js,"Selecting a single large bubble such as NETFLIX with a high subscriber count.","The bubble is sized appropriately large but still fits comfortably within the canvas with proper margins; the bubble floats without touching edges; text remains readable.","Pending – confirm the largest bubbles don't overwhelm the canvas or become unreadable.","This tests the boundary conditions of the sizing formula and ensures the layout handles edge cases gracefully.","Activate only NETFLIX which has a high subscriber count; check that the bubble is large but still has space around it and that the text is clear."
40,chartBubble.js main.js,"Selecting multiple bubbles with very different sizes such as a large NETFLIX and a smaller HULU.","Both bubbles are positioned with adequate spacing; the smaller bubble doesn't get hidden behind the larger one; both float independently at their own speeds.","Pending – record whether the size differences felt proportional and whether the layout handled the contrast well.","This checks that the grid positioning logic accounts for varying bubble sizes and doesn't create awkward overlaps.","Select NETFLIX and HULU together; observe how the different sized bubbles are arranged and whether they both remain clearly visible."
41,chartHeatmap.js main.js,"Switching to Heat Map view while no services are selected.","The heatmap canvas shows only a dark background and possibly the title area; there are no data rows and no errors are logged.","Pending – once tested, confirm there were no stray artifacts.","This is similar to other empty state checks but for the custom drawn heat map.","Click the Heat Map visualization option with zero selections; confirm that the chart space remains empty but the app is stable."
42,chartHeatmap.js main.js,"Selecting a single company such as NETFLIX while Heat Map is active.","One horizontal row of cells is drawn for that company with colors shifting over time to represent growth rates; the title Growth Rate Heat Map appears above.","Pending – record whether the color scale and row label felt intuitive.","This view should make it easy to quickly scan how a single service has been growing over time.","Turn on NETFLIX and choose Heat Map; inspect the row and title; verify that cell colors tend green when growth is positive and more muted when flat."
43,chartHeatmap.js main.js,"Selecting several services for example DISNEY NETFLIX and SPOTIFY while viewing the heat map.","Multiple labeled rows appear stacked vertically with a shared timeline; missing data points show as subtle placeholder cells rather than being left blank.","Pending – confirm the rows lined up correctly and no labels overlapped.","If things feel cramped, you might later tweak paddings or font sizes to keep this view readable.","Select at least three services and stay on Heat Map; scroll through the chart visually and confirm that every company has a labeled row and a continuous grid."
44,chartHeatmap.js main.js,"Observing numeric growth labels inside cells where there is enough space on a desktop sized window.","Many cells display rounded percentage values in white text centered within the colored background making the growth trend easy to read.","Pending – after inspection, note whether the text stayed legible across the chart.","This is mostly about typography and contrast but has a big effect on usability.","With the window at a comfortable width inspect a few rows; look for small percentage labels inside larger cells and compare them to the apparent color intensity."
45,chartHeatmap.js main.js,"Reviewing the legend at the bottom of the heat map.","A gradient bar appears running from a red tone on one side through neutral gray to a green tone on the other with Negative and Positive labels near the ends.","Pending – mark whether the legend made the color mapping clear at a glance.","A clear legend helps new users understand the view without needing extra documentation.","Scroll down to the bottom of the heatmap area; look at the color bar and confirm the text and gradient direction make sense."
